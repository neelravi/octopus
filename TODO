DONE mesh3D.F90  -> reintroduce vol_pp and change the rest accordingly
hartree.F90 -> clean up derivatives/integerals in cg
xc_lda.F90  -> handle ispin=4 properly (non-collinear spin)
xc_KLI*     -> DOIT
eigen*      -> sort out the eigen_solvers
mix.F90     -> sort out the broyden/andersen mixing
For polymers:
  change the occupancies in states_init, states_fermi
  add ks in states_init, Hpsi
  change mesh in mesh3D_create
  change boundary conditions in mesh3D_derivatives
  energy calculation in hamiltonian_energy
  change density calculation in calcdens
For non-collinear magnetism
  handle ispin=4 properly in xc_LDA.F90
  check how the energy (epot) is calculated (hamiltonian_setup)

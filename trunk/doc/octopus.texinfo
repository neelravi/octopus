@c ***************THE BODY OF THE DOCUMENT*******************************

@node Copying, Introduction, Top, Top
@chapter Copying

We have not settled down yet the legal details of the code. Eventually it
will be GPLed, but since the code is not working yet, you basically
have not the right to copy, modify, etc, which you wouldn't want to do it
anyhow.


@node Introduction, Compilation, Copying, Top
@c    node-name,     next,          previous,     up
@chapter Introduction

     
@code{octopus} @footnote{
From latin @emph{octopus}, set of animals belonging to the...
}
is a program aimed at the ab initio virtual experimentation on 
a hopefully ever increasing range of systems types.

@node Compilation, Description of input options, Introduction, Top
@chapter Compilation

The variables in the file @code{Make.arch} must be adapted to the computer,
compiler, preprocessor, etc. @code{arch} must be the output to the
"@code{uname -m}" command. Occasionally you may need to change variable
definitions in the first lines of the @code{Makefile}.

The variable @code{FORLIBS}, to be defined in @code{Make.arch}, contains
all the libraries that must be linked with the rest of the code. It must
contain, at least:

@code{FORLIBS = -ldrfftw -ldfftw -lblas -llapack -lgslcblas -lgsl -loct}

That is, inclusion of the FFTW@footnote{
@code{www.fftw.org}}
package libraries, BLAS/LAPACK@footnote{
@code{www.netlib.org}}
libraries, and the GNU Scientific Library @code{gsl}@footnote{
@code{www.gnu.org}}. All these libraries are GPLed and
freely distributed. The @code{-loct} links the @code{liboct.a} library,
which is compiled previous to the main code when issuing
@code{make}.

@c    node-name,     next,          previous,     up
@chapter Description of input options

The full description of the system to simulate on, and of the simulation
to perform, is done in a file called "inp" that must be present in
the directory where the @code{octopus} command is issued.

@section Generalities

@subsection @code{SystemName}:
@cindex @code{SystemName}
A string of characters that is used to build the filenames 
(@code{SystemName.restart}, @code{SystemName.mult}, etc).
@emph{Default: sysname.}

@subsection @code{CalculationMode}:
@cindex @code{CalculationMode}
Integer number. It defines the type of simulation to perform. Options are:
@itemize @bullet
@item @code{1} : Start static calculation
@item @code{2} : Resume static calculation
@item @code{3} : calculate unocuppied states
@item @code{4} : resume unocuppied states calculation
@item @code{5} : start td
@item @code{6} : resume td
@item @code{7} : start static polarizability
@item @code{8} : resume static polarizability
@item @code{9} : perform Born-Oppenheimer MD
@item @code{99} : prints out the "Pulpo a Feira" recipe
@end itemize
@emph{Default: 1.}

@subsection @code{Verbose}:
Level of verbosity in the output.

@section Describing the species

@section Describing the atoms

@section Describing the electrons

@section Mesh parameters

The real-space mesh is an equally-spaced one, although the spacings maybe
different for each direction. The shape of the simulation region may also
be tuned to suit the geometric configuration of the system.

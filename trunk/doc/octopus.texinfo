@c ***************THE BODY OF THE DOCUMENT*******************************

@node Copying, Introduction, Top, Top
@chapter Copying

We have not settled down yet the legal details of the code. Eventually it
will be GPLed, but since the code is not working yet, you basically
have not the right to copy, modify, etc, which you wouldn't want to do it
anyhow.

@c    node-name,     next,          previous,     up
@chapter Introduction

     
@code{octopus} @footnote{
From latin @emph{octopus}, set of animals belonging to the...
}
is a program aimed at the ab initio virtual experimentation on 
a hopefully ever increasing range of systems types.


@node Description of input options, Concept Index, Introduction, Top
@c    node-name,     next,          previous,     up
@chapter Description of input options

The full description of the system to simulate on, and of the simulation
to perform, is done in a file called "inp" that must be present in
the directory where the @code{octopus} command is issued.

@section Generalities

@subsection @code{SystemName}:
@cindex @code{SystemName}
A string of characters that is used to build the filenames 
(@code{SystemName.restart}, @code{SystemName.mult}, etc).
@emph{Default: sysname.}

@subsection @code{CalculationMode}:
@cindex @code{CalculationMode}
Integer number. It defines the type of simulation to perform. Options are:
@itemize @bullet
@item @code{1} : Start static calculation
@item @code{2} : Resume static calculation
@item @code{3} : calculate unocuppied states
@item @code{4} : resume unocuppied states calculation
@item @code{5} : start td
@item @code{6} : resume td
@item @code{7} : start static polarizability
@item @code{8} : resume static polarizability
@item @code{9} : perform Born-Oppenheimer MD
@item @code{99} : prints out the "Pulpo a Feira" recipe
@end itemize
@emph{Default: 1.}

@subsection @code{Verbose}:
Level of verbosity in the output.

@section Describing the species

@section Describing the atoms

@section Describing the electrons

@section Mesh parameters

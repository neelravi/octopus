# This tests performs the calculation of an Argon atom making
# use of the local-density approximation (LDA) plus the self-interaction 
# correction (SIC), treating this latter term with the Krieger-Li-Iafrate
# approximation (KLI) to the optimized effective potential method (OEP).
# This is the functional used in:
# [X.-M. Tong and S.-I Chu, Phys. Rev. B 55, 3406 (1997)],
# to the best of my knowledge for the first time.
#
# The calculation reproduces the result given for Ar in Table IV of this paper.
# It is the value of the energy of the HOMO (a.k.a. ionization potential): 0.549Ha.
#
# The number is missed by 0.006Ha = 0.16eV. The reason is probably that we
# use a LDA pseudopotential, whereas the results in the paper is all-electron.

Test       : 1D Asymmetric Double Well
Author     : Alberto
Date       : 10.10.07
Arch       : Linux 
Release    : 2.2.0pre1
Programs   : octopus
TestGroups : long-run, oct
Enabled    : Yes

# The test ensures a number features of the optimal control implementation in octopus.
# It replicates some of the results given in:
# J. Werschnik and E. K. U. Gross, J. Opt. B: Quantum Semiclass. Opt 7, S300 (2005).
#
# First, we obtain the two lowest eigenstates of the asymmetric double well:
#
# V(x) = 1/64*(x)^4-1/4*(x)^2+1/256*(x)^3
#
Input: 05-adw.01-ground_state.inp
Match ; TotalEnergy ; sed -n '/^Energy/{n\;p\;}' ground_state_static/info ; \s*Total\s*=\s*-0.6206
Match ; 2th state  ; grep '2   --' excited_states_static/eigenvalues ; \s*-0.4638

# Now we run an OCT run identical (or almost, the numerical parameters
# are slightly different) to the one described in section 5.1.1, and
# in Fig. 2. It transfers the particle from the left well to the right
# well, by making use of the WG05 algorithm, and with a fixed fluence.
#
# It runs for only two iterations (which is enough to test that the
# implementation is working), but if it is continued it replicates
# nicely the results given in Fig. 2.
Input: 05-adw.02-filter_fixed.inp
Match ; J1 1st  iteration  ; grep ' 1  ' opt-control/convergence ; \s*-0.2129\d*\s*0.0006
Match ; J1 2nd  iteration  ; grep ' 2  ' opt-control/convergence ; \s*0.540\d*\s*0.580

# Now use add a filter. This corresponds to the case presented in
# Fig. 5 of the same paper. Once again, we stop at iteration #2; 
# however if the run is continued it reproduces nicely the result 
# given in the paper (not exactly, due probably to small numerical 
# differences).
Input: 05-adw.03-filter_indirect.inp
Match ; J1 1st  iteration  ; grep ' 1  ' opt-control/convergence ; \s*1\s*0.161\d*\s*0.163
Match ; J1 2nd  iteration  ; grep ' 2  ' opt-control/convergence ; \s*2\s*0.412\d*\s*0.415

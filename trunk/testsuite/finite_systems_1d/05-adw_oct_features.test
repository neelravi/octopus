Test       : 1D Asymmetric Double Well
Author     : Jan Werschnik
Date       : 20.06.06
Arch       : Linux 
Release    : 2.2.0pre1
Programs   : octopus
TestGroups : long-run
Enabled    : Yes

# The test ensures a number features of the optimal control implementation in octopus.
# 
# We do the following intermediate steps:
# First, the two lowest eigenstates of the asymmetric double well,
# V(x) = 1/64*(x)^4-1/4*(x)^2+1/256*(x)^3,
# are calculated.
# A similar potential is used in Rev Mod (Haenggi, Griffoni)


Input: 05-adw.01-ground_state.inp

Match ; TotalEnergy ; grep -A 7 '^Energy:' ground_state_static/info ; \s*Total\s*=\s*-0.6206
Match ; 2th state  ; grep '2   --' excited_states_static/eigenvalues ; \s*-0.4638

# Now use filter and optimize direct transition to 1st excited state with a predefined fluence.

Input: 05-adw.02-filter_fixed.inp

# Match overlaps
Match ; J1 1st  iteration  ; grep ' 1  ' opt-control/convergence ; \s*0.987\d*
Match ; J1 2nd  iteration  ; grep ' 2  ' opt-control/convergence ; \s*0.988\d*

# Now use filter and optimize indirect transition via 3rd excited state.

Input: 05-adw.03-filter_indirect.inp

# Match overlaps 
Match ; J1 1st  iteration  ; grep ' 1  ' opt-control/convergence ; \s*0.062\d*
Match ; J1 2nd  iteration  ; grep ' 2  ' opt-control/convergence ; \s*0.195\d*
# The run stops at iter number two; however it should continue further to see that
# the result actually converges. Apparently, however, the algorithm is unstable
# and produces different results in different machines.

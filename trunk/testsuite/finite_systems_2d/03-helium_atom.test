# The following tests do not describe the calculation of a two-dimensional
# model, but of a one-dimensional model of a system of two electrons. It is
# run, however, in two-dimensional mode -- mathematically it is equivalent.
#
# It is an exact calculation of a one-dimensional system of two electrons
# that interact through a soft-Coulomb potential. The external potential is
# also a soft-Coulomb interaction.


# This first example reproduces the ground-state calculation present in
# [M. S. Pindzola, D. C Griffin and C. Bottcher, Phys. Rev. Lett. 66, 2305 (1991)].
# In this case, the electron-electron interaction is not exactly a soft-Coulomb
# interaction. The total energy reproduces the -77.3eV quoted in the paper.

# This second example reproduces the ground-state calculation present in
# [W.-C. Liu et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 520 (1999)]
# The total energy reproduces the -2.238Ha quoted in the paper.

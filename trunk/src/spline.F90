!/*!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! This module contains a data type (loct_spline_type) to contain 1D functions,
! along with a series of procedures to manage them (to define them, to obtain
! its values, to operate on them, etc). The internal representation of the
! functions is done through cubic splines, handled by the GSL library. For
! the user of the module, this internal representation is hidden, one just
! works with what are called hereafter "spline functions".
!
! WARNINGS:
!  * The problem of precision has been disregarded, so it probably does not
!    work if the code is compiled with single precision. To be fixed.
!
! To define a function, one must supply a set {x(i),y(i)} of pairs of values
! -- the abscissa and the value of the function.
!
! [*] DATA TYPE:
!     To define a spline function:
!     type(loct_spline_type) :: f
!
! [1] INITIALIZATION:
!     Before using any function, one should initialize it:
!
!     Interface:
!     subroutine loct_spline_init(spl)
!        type(loct_spline_type), intent(out) :: spl [or spl(:) or spl(:, :)]
!     end subroutine loct_spline_init
!
!     Usage:
!     call loct_spline_init(f)
!
! [2] FINALIZATION:
!     To empty any allocated space, one should finalize the function:
!
!     Interface:
!     subroutine loct_spline_end(spl)
!        type(loct_spline_type), intent(inout) :: spl [or spl(:) or spl(:, :)]
!     end subroutine loct_spline_end
!
!     Usage
!     type(loct_spline_type) :: f
!     call loct_spline_end(f)
!
! [3] TO DEFINE A FUNCTION:
!     To "fill" an initialized function f,use loct_spline_fit
!
!     Interface:
!     subroutine loct_spline_fit(n, x, y, spl)
!        integer, intent(in) :: nrc
!        real(X), intent(in) :: x(n), y(n)
!        type(loct_spline_type), intent(out) :: spl
!     end subroutine spline_fit8
!
!     (X may be 4 or eight, for single or double precision)
!
!     Usage:
!     call loct_spline_fit(n, x, y, f)
!     n is the number of values that are supplied, x the abscissas, and y
!     the value of the function to represent at each point.
!
! [4] FUNCTION VALUES:
!     To retrieve the value of a function at a given point:
!
!     Interface:
!
!     real(8) function loct_splint(spl, x)
!       type(loct_spline_type), intent(in) :: spl
!       real(8), intent(in) :: x
!     end function loct_splint
!
!     Usage:
!     To retrieve the value of function f at point x, and place it into
!     real value val:
!     val = loct_splint(f, x)
!
! [5] SUM:
!     If you have two defined functions, f and g, and an initialized function
!     h, you may sum f and g and place the result onto g. For this purpose,
!     the grid that defined the first operand, f, will be used -- the values
!     of g will be interpolated to get the sum and place it in h.
!
!     Interface:
!     subroutine loct_spline_sum(spl1, spl2, splsum)
!       type(loct_spline_type), intent(in)  :: spl1, spl2
!       type(loct_spline_type), intent(out) :: splsum
!     end subroutine loct_spline_sum
!
!     Usage:
!     call loct_spline_init(f)
!     call loct_spline_init(g)
!     call loct_spline_init(h)
!     call loct_spline_fit(npointsf, xf, yf, f)
!     call loct_spline_fit(npointsg, xg, yg, g)
!     call loct_spline_sum(f, g, h)
!
! [6] MULTIPLICATION BY A SCALAR
!     You may multiply a given spline-represented spline by a real number:
!
!     Interface:
!     subroutine loct_spline_times(a, spl)
!       type(loct_spline_type), intent(inout)  :: spl
!       real(8), intent(in) :: a
!     end subroutine loct_spline_times
!
!     Usage:
!     call loct_spline_init(f)
!     call loct_spline_fit(npoints, x, y, f) ! Fill f with y values at x points
!     call loct_spline_times(a, f) ! Now f contains a*y values at x points.
!
! [7] INTEGRAL:
!     Given a defined function, the function loct_spline_integral returns its
!     integral. The interval of integration may or may not be supplied.
!
!     Interface:
!     real(8) function loct_spline_integral(spl [,a,b])
!       type(loct_spline_integral), intent(in) :: spl
!       real(8), intent(in), optional :: a, b
!     end function loct_spline_integral
!
! [8] DOT PRODUCT:
!     Given two defined functions f and g, the function loct_spline_dotp returns
!     the value of their dot-product: int {dx f(x)*g(x)}. The mesh used to do
!     so the mesh of the fist-function (note that as a result the definition
!     is no longer conmutative).
!
!     Interface:
!     real(8) function loct_spline_dotp(spl1, spl2)
!       type(loct_spline_type), intent(in) :: spl1, spl2
!     end function loct_spline_dotp
!
! Note: The following routines, loct_spline_3dft, loct_spline_cut and loct_spline_filter,
! assume that the spline functions are the radial part of a 3 dimensional function with
! spherical symmetry. This is why the Fourier transform of F(\vec{r}) = f(r), is:
!       F(\vec{g}) = f(g) = \frac{4\pi}{g} \int_{0}^{\infty} { r*sin(g*r)*f(r) }
! which coincides with the inverse Fourier transform, except that the inverse Fourier
! transform should be multiplied by a (2*\pi)^{-3} factor.
!
! [9] FOURIER TRANSFORM:
!     If a spline function f is representing the radial part of a spherically
!     symmetric fuction F(\vec{r}), its Fourier transform is:
!       F(\vec{g}) = f(g) = \frac{4\pi}{g} \int_{0}^{\infty} { r*sin(g*r)*f(r) }
!     It is assumed that f is defined in some interval [0,rmax], and that it is
!     null at rmax and beyond. One may obtain f(g) by using loct_spline_3dft.
!     The result is placed on the spline data type splw. This has to be initialized,
!     and may or may not be filled. If it is filled, the abscissas that it has
!     are used to define the function. If it is not filled, an equally spaced
!     grid is constructed to define the faction, in the interval [0, gmax], where
!     gmax has to be supplied by the caller.
!
!     Interface:
!     subroutine loct_spline_3dft(spl, splw, gmax)
!       type(loct_spline_type), intent(in)    :: spl
!       type(loct_spline_type), intent(inout) :: splw
!       real(8), intent(in), optional :: gmax
!     end subroutine loct_spline_3dft
!
! [10] BESSEL TRANSFORM:
!
!
! [11] CUTTING A FUNCTION:
!     loct_spline_cut multiplies a given function by a cutoff-function, which
!     is defined to be one in [0, cutoff], and \exp\{-beta*(x/cutoff-1)^2\}
!
!     Interface:
!     subroutine loct_spline_cut(spl, cutoff, beta)
!       type(loct_spline_type), intent(in) :: spl
!       real(8), intent(in) :: cutoff, beta
!     end subroutine loct_spline_cut
!
! [12] FILTERING A FUNCTION, BOTH IN REAL AND FOURIER SPACE:
!     The function loct_spline_filter permits to filter out high-values
!     of a given spline function, either in real or in Fourier space.
!     If the optional argument fs is supplied, a filter in Fourier space
!     will be done by moving to the Fourier representation and then calling 
!     loct_spline_cut with cutoff = fs(1) and beta = fs(2). If the optional 
!     argument rs is supplied, a filter in real space will be done by calling 
!     loct_spline_cut with cutoff = rs(1) and beta = rs(2). If both arguments
!     are supplied, the Fourier filter will be applied *before*.
!
!     Interface:
!     subroutine loct_spline_filter(spl, fs, rs)
!       type(loct_spline_type), intent(inout) :: spl
!       real(8), intent(in), optional :: fs(2)
!       real(8), intent(in), optional :: rs(2)
!     end subroutine loct_spline_filter
!
! [13] PRINTING A FUNCTION:
!     It prints to a file the (x,y) values that were used to define a function.
!     The file is pointed by its Fortran unit given by argument iunit.
!
!     Interface:
!     subroutine loct_spline_print(spl, iunit)
!       type(loct_spline_type), intent(in) :: spl [ or spl(:) or spl(:, :)]
!       integer, intent(in) :: iunit
!     end subroutine loct_spline_print

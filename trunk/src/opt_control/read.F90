    !%Description
    !% In order to find the optimal laser field for a given task, e.g., the excitation from an
    !% initial state to a predefined final state at the final time, optimal control theory can 
    !% be applied to quantum mechanics. The mathematical derivation leads a set of equations 
    !% which require the propagation of the wavefunction and a lagrange multiplier (sometimes
    !% comparable to a wavefunction). Several schemes have been sought to solve these control 
    !% equations which boils down to forward and backward propagations. However, the order in
    !% which these equations are solved makes a huge difference. Some schemes can be proven 
    !% to increase the value of the target functional (merit function) in each step. (In 
    !% practice this can be violated if the accuracy of the numerical time propagation is
    !% small. Most likely in 3D.)
    !%Option oct_algorithm_zbr98 1 
    !% Backward-Forward-Backward scheme described in JCP 108, 1953 (1998).
    !% Only possible if targetoperator is a projection operator
    !% Provides the fastest and most stable convergence.
    !% Monotonic convergence.
    !%Option oct_algorithm_zr98  2
    !% Forward-Backward-Forward scheme described in JCP 109,385 (1998).
    !% Works for projection and local target operators
    !% Convergence is stable but slower than ZBR98. 
    !% Note that local operators show an extremely slow convergence.
    !% Monotonic convergence.
    !%Option oct_algorithm_wg05  3
    !% Forward-Backward scheme described in J. Opt. B. 7 300 (2005).
    !% Works for all kind target operators and 
    !% can be used with all kind of filters and allows a fixed fluence.
    !% The price is a rather instable convergence. 
    !% If the restrictions set by the filter and fluence are reasonable, a good overlap can be 
    !% expected with 20 iterations.
    !% No monotonic convergence.
    !%Option oct_algorithm_mt03 4
    !% Yet to be implemented and tested. Basically an improved and generalized scheme. 
    !% Comparable to ZBR98/ZR98. See [Y. Maday and G. Turinici, J. Chem. Phys. 118, 
    !% 8191 (2003)].

  !%Description
  !% The oct-harmonic-spectrum utility program needs to know the direction along
  !% which the emission raidiation is considered to be polarized. It may be
  !% linearly polarized or circularly polarized.
  !%Option "x"
  !% Linearly polarized field in the x direction.
  !%Option "y"
  !% Linearly polarized field in the y direction.
  !%Option "z"
  !% Linearly polarized field in the z direction.
  !%Option "+"
  !% Circularly polarized field, counter clock-wise.
  !%Option "-"
  !% Circularly polarized field, clock-wise.

  !%Description
  !% The oct-harmonic-spectrum may calculate the spectrum in two alternative ways,
  !% mathematically equivalent but numerically diferent: by reading the dipole
  !% moment (from the multipoles file) and calculating the accelaratio numerically
  !% from it, or by reading directly the acceleration from the acceleration file,
  !% which may also be generated during a time-dependent run of octopus.
  !%Option hs_from_dipole 1
  !% Calculate the harmonic spectrum by numerically differentiating the multipoles file.
  !%Option hs_from_acceleration 2
  !% Calculate the harmonic spectrum by reading the acceleration file.

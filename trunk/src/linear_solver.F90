    !%Section Linear Response::Solver
    !%Description
    !% To calculate response using density functional perturbation
    !% theory is necessary to solve the sterheimer equation, this is a self
    !% consistent linear equation where the operator is the Kohn-Sham
    !% hamiltonian with a complex shift. This variable selects which
    !% method to use in order to solve this linear equation.
    !%Option hx 10
    !% This solver aproximates the solution of the non-hermitian
    !% equation by a power series in terms of the inverse of the
    !% hamiltonian. Each term implies solving a hermitian linear equation by
    !% conjugated gradients.
    !% Altough this might sound inefficient, the hermitian equations
    !% to solve are better conditioned than the original, so this can be more
    !% efficient than a non-hermitian solver.
    !% This version of the solvers apply the number of terms in the
    !% series as needed to be under the tolerance required.
    !%Option hx_fixed 11
    !% This is the same prevoius solver, but only two steps of the
    !% series are applied.
    !%Option cg 5
    !% Conjugated gradients. This is the fastest solver but does not
    !% work when an imaginary shift is added. This is the default.
    !%Option bicgstab 3
    !% Biconjugated gradients stabilized. This is an improved version
    !% of bcg that is faster and more stable. This is the default when
    !% complex polarizabilities are calculated.

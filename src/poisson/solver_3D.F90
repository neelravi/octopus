  !%Variable PoissonSolverIncreaseBox
  !%Type logical
  !%Section Hamiltonian::Poisson
  !%Description
  !% In case the selected Poisson solver is cg or cg_corrected, the boundary conditions
  !% have to be calculated by means of performing a multipole expansion. Unfortunately,
  !% if the charge distribution is not contained in a simulation box of approximately
  !% spherical shape, the error can be quite large. Good cases are the spherical box,
  !% the parallelpiped when all dimensions are of similar magnitude, or the cylinder
  !% in case the height is not too different to the diameter of the base. Bad cases
  !% are the rest, including the "minimum" box, when the geometry of the molecule is
  !% not compact enough.
  !%
  !% In order to cure this problem, the Hartree problem may be solved in an auxiliary
  !% simulation box, which will contain the original one, but which will be a sphere.
  !% This implies some extra computational effort -- since the density and potential have
  !% to be transferred between boxes -- and extra memory consumption -- since a new
  !% grid has to be stored, which may need quite a lot of memory if you use curvilinear
  !% coordinates.

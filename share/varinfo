Variable NonInteractingElectrons
Type logical
Description
 Sometimes  it  may  be  helpful  to  treat the electrons as non-interacting
 particles,  i.e., not to take into account Hartree and exchange-correlation
 effects  between  the  electrons.  This variable may be used to toogle this
 behavior on and off
Option no 0
 Electrons are treated as *interacting* particles
Option yes 1
 Electrons are handled as *non-interacting* paticles

For the inpatients, here goes the quick-start: 

gzip -cd octopus<-version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -
cd octopus-<version>
./configure
make
make install

This will probably *not* work, so before giving up, just check:

./configure --help 

for a list of options you may want to set, and read the manual (in the doc 
directory).

@section What are these @emph{atomic units}?

Atomic units are a Gaussian system of units (by ``Gaussian'' I mean that the
vacuum dielectric constant has no dimensins and is set to be @tex
$\epsilon_0 = {1 \over {4\pi}}$
@end tex
), in which the numerical values of the Bohr radius, the electronic
charge, the electronic mass, and the reduced Planck's constant are set to one:
@tex
$$
\eqalignno{a_0 &= 1;\> e^2 = 1;\> m_e = 1;\>\hbar = 1.&(1)\cr}
$$
@end tex
This simplifies formulae.@footnote{
Although, in my opinion, seriously hazards dimensionality analysis,
formulae interpretation and understanding, and Physics in general.
But this is just a personal taste.
} This sets directly two fundamental units: the atomic
units of length and of mass:
@tex
$$
\eqalignno{
{\rm au}_{\rm length} &= a_0 = 5.2917721\times 10^{-11}~{\rm m};\quad 
{\rm au}_{\rm mass} = m_e = 9.1093819\times 10^{-31}~{\rm kg}.&(2)\cr}
$$
@tex
Since the squared charge must have units of energy times length, we can thus
set the atomic unit of energy:
@tex
$$
\eqalignno{
{\rm au}_{\rm energy} &= {e^2 \over a_0} = 4.3597438\times 10^{-18}~{\rm J},&(3)\cr}
$$
@tex
which it is called Hartree, Ha. And, since the energy has units of mass times
length squared per time squared, this help us get the atomic unit of time:
@tex
$$
\eqalignno{
{\rm Ha} &= m_e { a_0^2 \over {\rm} {\rm au}_{\rm time}^2} \to 
{\rm au}_{\rm time} = a_0 \sqrt{m_e \over {\rm Ha}} = {a_0 \over e} \sqrt{m_e a_0}
= 2.4188843\times 10^{-17}~{\rm s}.&(4)\cr}
$$
@end tex
Now the catch is: what about Planck's constant? Its dimensions are of energy
times time, and thus we should be able to derive its value by now. But at the
beginning we set it to one! The point is that from the four physics constants
used (@tex
$a_0, m_e, e^2, \hbar$
@end tex
) are not independent, since:
@tex
$$
\eqalignno{
a_0 &=  { \hbar^2 \over {m_e \; {e^2 \over {4 \pi \epsilon_0} } } }&(5)\cr}
$$
@end tex
In this way, we could actually have derived the atomic unit of time in an
easier way, using Planck's constant:
@tex
$$
\eqalignno{
\hbar &= 1\; {\rm Ha}\,{\rm au}_{\rm time} \to {\rm au}_{\rm time} 
      = { \hbar \over {\rm Ha}} = 
{ {\hbar a_0} \over e^2}.&(6)\cr}
$$
@end tex
And combining (6) and (5) we retrieve (4).


@node What are these @emph{convenient units}?, How do I set a laser pulse of x W/cm2 of intensity?, What are these @emph{atomic units}?, Units
@section What are these @emph{convenient units}?

A lot of the literature in this field is written using @AA{}nstr@"oms and electron-volts
as the units of length and of energy, respectively. So it may be ``convenient''
to define a system of units, derived of the atomic system of units, in which
we make that substitution. And so we will call it ``convenient''.

The unit mass remains the same, and thus the unit of time must change, being
now the @tex
$\hbar /{\rm eV}\,.$

@ifinfo
The detailed explanation of this needs formulae to be displayed. Please
refer to a printed (dvi, for example) version of this FAQ.
@end ifinfo

@ifnotinfo
The relation between the peak intensity, @tex
$I_0,$
@end tex
and the peak electric field, @tex
$E_0,$
@end tex
is given by
@tex
$$
I_0 = {\textstyle{1 \over 2}} \; c \; \epsilon_0 \; E_0^2.
$$
@end tex
That is, in a Gaussian system of units (@tex
$\epsilon_0 = {{1} \over {4\pi}}$
@end tex
), we have @tex
$E_0 = \sqrt{ {{8\pi} \over {c}} \; I_0 }$.
@end tex

The amplitude of the laser field is specified in the input file through a numerical
value @tex
$x$
@end tex
in the lasers block. The question is thus how to relate this value to watts per
squared centimeter. The two formulae that produce this task are:

@itemize
@item If atomics units are used in the input file:
@tex
$
I_{0} = 3.5094\times 10^{16}\,x^2\rm~W/cm^2
$
@end tex
@item If convenient units are used in the input file:
@tex
$
I_{0} = 1.3272\times 10^{13}\,x^2\rm~W/cm^2
$
@end tex
@end itemize
These formulae may be derived from previous equation and a bit of units handling. It is 
important to note that the amplitude introduced in the input file does not correspond to the
electric field amplitude @tex
$E$,
@end tex
but to the corresponding force, @tex
$e\,E\,.$
@end tex
This is numerically irrelevant in the case of atomic units, but it is important to derive the
expression for convenient units. In this case, one should just note that @tex
$e^2 = 14.399644\rm~eV\,\AA$.

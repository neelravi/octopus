@node Copying,      Introduction,   Top,          Top
@chapter Copying

We have not settled down yet the legal details of the code. Eventually it
will be GPLed, but since the code is not working yet, you basically
have not the right to copy, modify, etc, which you wouldn't want to do it
anyhow.

@chapter Introduction

     
@code{octopus} is a program aimed at the ab initio virtual experimentation on 
a hopefully ever increasing range of systems types.

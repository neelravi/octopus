What are these _atomic units_?
==============================

   Atomic units are a Gaussian system of units (by "Gaussian" I mean
that the vacuum dielectric constant has no dimensions and is set to be
\epsilon_0 = 1 \over 4\pi), in which the numerical values of the Bohr
radius, the electronic charge, the electronic mass, and the reduced
Planck's constant are set to one:

   a0 = 1; e^2 = 1; m_e = 1; \hbar = 1.   (1)

   This simplifies formulae.(1) This sets directly two fundamental
units: the atomic units of length and of mass:

   au[length] = a0 = 5.2917721*10^(-11) m,   (2a)

   au[mass] = m_e = 9.1093819*10^(-31) kg.   (2b) Since the squared
charge must have units of energy times length, we can thus set the
atomic unit of energy:

   au[energy] = e^2/a0 = 4.3597438*10^(-18) J,   (3) which it is called
Hartree, Ha. And, since the energy has units of mass times length
squared per time squared, this help us get the atomic unit of time:

   Ha = m_e a0^2/au[time]^2 => au[time] = \hbar/Ha = \hbar a0/e^2.   (4)

   Now the catch is: what about Planck's constant? Its dimensions are
of energy times time, and thus we should be able to derive its value by
now. But at the beginning we set it to one! The point is that from the
four physics constants used (a_0, m_e, e^2, \hbar) are not independent,
since:

   a_0 = \hbar^2/(m_e e^2/[4\pi\epsilon_0]).   (5)

   In this way, we could actually have derived the atomic unit of time
in an easier way, using Planck's constant:

   \hbar = 1 Ha au[time] => au[time] = \hbar/Ha = \hbar a0/e^2.   (6)

   And combining (6) and (5) we retrieve (4).

   (1) Although, in my opinion, it seriously hazards dimensionality
analysis, formulae interpretation and understanding, and Physics in
general.  But this is just a personal taste.

What are these _convenient units_?
==================================

   A lot of the literature in this field is written using AAngstro"ms
and electron-volts as the units of length and of energy, respectively.
So it may be "convenient" to define a system of units, derived from the
atomic system of units, in which we make that substitution. And so we
will call it "convenient".

   The unit mass remains the same, and thus the unit of time must
change, being now \hbar /\rm eV, with \hbar = 6.582\,1220(20)\times
10^-16~\rm eV\,s.

How do I set a laser pulse of x W/cm2 of intensity?
===================================================

   The relation between the peak intensity, I_0, and the peak electric
field, E_0, is given by

   I0 = 1/2 c epsilon0 E0^2.

   That is, in a Gaussian system of units (\epsilon_0 = 1 \over 4\pi),
we have E_0 = \sqrt 8\pi \over c \; I_0 .

   The amplitude of the laser field is specified in the input file
through a numerical value x in the lasers block. The question is thus
how to relate this value to watts per squared centimeter. The two
formulae that produce this task are:

   * If atomics units are used in the input file: I_0 = 3.5094\times
     10^16\,x^2\rm~W/cm^2

   * If convenient units are used in the input file: I_0 = 1.3272\times
     10^13\,x^2\rm~W/cm^2

   These formulae may be derived from previous equation and a bit of
units handling. It is important to note that the amplitude introduced
in the input file does not correspond to the electric field amplitude
E, but to the corresponding force, e\,E.  This is numerically
irrelevant in the case of atomic units, but it is important to derive
the expression for convenient units. In this case, one should just note
that e^2 = 14.399644\rm~eV\,\AA.

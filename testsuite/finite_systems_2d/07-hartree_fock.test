Test       : Hartree-Fock

# This tests the Hartree-Fock implementation. It reproduces one number
# given in: [B. Reusch et al., Phys. Rev. B 63, 113313]. I have chose
# a 2D calculation because of the great computational load produced by
# Hartree-Fock calculation.
#
# The input file produces an unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculation for
# a two-electron quantum-dot in an S=1 configuration. The details of
# the calculation correspond to the first row of Table I in the
# aforementioned paper. The units in that table are given in units of
# "omega", and since omega in this case is 0.25 effective atomic
# units, 1.0419 e.a.u. corresponds to 4.168, as given in the table.

Input: 07-hartree_fock.01-2electrons.inp
match ; Total energy ; GREP(static/info, 'Total       =', 20) ; 1.04191861

# Results for 8 electrons quantum dots, provided in the paper, can
# also be approximately reproduced. I do not put a test because it
# would be too slow. In fact, the results provided by octopus are
# lower in energy and closer to the Quantum Monte Carlo numbers, which
# could be do to the use of an underconverged basis set in the paper.
